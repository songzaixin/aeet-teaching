## Development of Multimode Axial-Flux Double-rotor Motor Drive System for Hybrid Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (NSFC 52077186)

### Research Project -- Participant -- Sep-2021 ~ Apr-2022

***Abstract***:   Hybrid electric unmanned aerial vehicles (HE-UAVs) have redefined the propulsion structure of UAVs. By combing the fuel energy and electric energy together, the HE-UAVs can accomplish multiple operations and long endurance, which has significant research values for enlarging the application scenarios of UAVs. Focusing on the problem that existing hybrid propulsion systems are unsuitable for the complex flight tasks of UAVs, a novel high-power-density integrated axial double-rotor machine drive system with multiple operation modes is proposed. 

***Responsible for***:   Double-rotor propulsion motor design and control, multi-physics design optimization, and prototype experiments.

## Development of New Wireless Electric Machines (Shenzhen Basic Research Grant JCYJ20180307123918658)

### Research Project -- Particiant -- Jan-2019 ~ Dec-2021

***Abstract***:    This project pioneers the proposal of a new type of wireless motor drive, combined with corresponding control strategies, to realize the remote drive of industrial machines. Wireless motor drive adopts a structure that combines wireless power transfer and electric motor design. The transmitting coil is coupled with different receiving coils based on the principle of time-division multiplexing, and the receiving coil forms electromagnetic field inside the motor. Both energy conversion and, on the transmitter coil side the physical isolation control can be achieved through position sensors or current sensors. Proposed wireless motor drive has the merits of high reliability, high portability, and physical isolation, which expands its application the range to certain industrial remote-control scenes. 

***Responsible for***:    Design of wireless motor drive, topology design of receiving coils on the stator.

## Design of an Effective Integrated Motor Drive System with Wide-Bandgap Power Devices (CityU Applied Research Grant ARG 9667214)

### Research Project -- Particiant -- Mar-2020 ~ Feb-2022

***Abstract***:    To further improve the performance and integration of motor drive system, the Electrical Energy and Power Technology (EEPT) group, at City University of Hong Kong, has developed two new types of integrated motor drive (IMD) systems based on the conventional power devices, which particularly combine the motor and drive together. Compared with the existing motor drive, the first type of motor drive has the better torque density and the second type has the better power density. By combining the power drive with the well-designed motor together, the new IMD systems have achieved the better performances than most matured existing ones under the same power level and size. 

***Responsible for***:    Design optimization of integrated motor drive, first- and second-round prototype fabrication, experiments, and performance evaluation.
